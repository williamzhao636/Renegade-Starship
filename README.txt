Project Name: Renegade Starship

Description: This is a game where the player is in control of a spaceship which starts out as a collection of relatively weak parts. The mission is to fly around the map and defeat enemy spaceships in order to become more powerful. As the player defeats spaceships, they slowly make their way towards a location on the map representing the win condition. However, it√ïll be a tough fight to get past all the defenses around the objective.

Running the program: Only the __init__.py file needs to be ran in order to start the program. The project will also create a Saves.txt file to store a saved player ship. This will appear in the same directory as the __init__ file.  Because the project also contains folders for images and object Classes, these folders should be in the same directory as the __init__ file too.

Required Libraries: Pygame is necessary in order to run the program.
