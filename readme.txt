*IMPORTANT* - Currently, if the program runs into an error while in fullscreen and crashes, there is no way to close the program other than restarting the computer. I have researched solutions to this problem online and asked TAs in Office Hours but there hasn't been a fix that works for me.


Project Name: Renegade Starship

Description: This is a game where the player is in control of a spaceship which starts out as a collection of relatively weak parts. The mission is to fly around the map and defeat enemy spaceships in order to become more powerful. As the player defeats spaceships, they slowly make their way towards a location on the map representing the win condition. However, it’ll be a tough fight to get past all the defenses around the objective.

Running the program: Only the __init__.py file needs to be ran in order to start the program. The project will also create a “Saves.txt” file to store a saved player ship. This will appear in the same folder as the __init__ file.  Because the project also contains folders for images and object Classes, these folders should be in the same directory as the __init__ file too.

Installed Libraries: Pygame is the only uninstalled library necessary to run the program. 

Shortcut Commands: There are no shortcut commands.
